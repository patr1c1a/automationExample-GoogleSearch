# Automation example

This was a demo I had to do, where I was asked to automate a single test that performs a Google search.

* Tools used: Selenium Webdriver (v. 3.11), Cucumber (v. 1.2.5), Java JDK (v. 1.8), JUnit (4.12), Maven (v. 3.2.5), Chromedriver (v. 2.36.540470 for Windows).
* Environment: IntelliJ IDEA Community 2017.3, Windows (v. 10 - 64 bit), Chrome (v. 65.0.3325.181).

------------------------------------------------------------------

## Running the project

Make sure you have Maven and Java JDK installed and MAVEN_HOME as well as JAVA_HOME pointing to the right directories.

Clone or download the project to the local drive. Within a command prompt window/terminal, navigate to it. Then run "mvn clean test".

E.g.:

cd C:/automationExample-GoogleSearch

mvn clean test

------------------------------------------------------------------

## Test:

This demo only runs one test:
- Given I go to www.google.com
- and I type 'Seleniumhq' in the searchbox
- and I press 'ENTER' in the searchbox
- and I click on 'Selenium HQ' link
- Then IÂ´m on Selenium HQ Page

------------------------------------------------------------------

**Project structure and patterns used:**

The project uses the Page Object Model pattern to separate the actions performed on each page from the actual test logic. 
Location strategy chosen is CSS selectors, and it was done by using a PageFactory object (which provides POM support).

If there is a failed step, a screenshot will be captured and stored in the /target directory.

Project structure is as follows:
* src/test/features: Cucumber feature file using Gherkin language.
* src/test/resources/drivers: browser drivers used by Selenium (only Chrome driver available in this example).
* src/test/java/steps: implementation of test steps in feature file. Also, hooks are placed in this package.
* src/test/pageObjects: classes representing each page used in test steps (Page Object Model)
* src/test/utils: other utilities (Screenshot class)
* src/test/runner: JUnit runner to set up project configuration.

The Hooks class contains a static WebDriver object that will be used throughout the test suite, as well as test setup and teardown actions.
